Overview
This React Native project is a straightforward e-commerce application, featuring a product listing screen and a cart screen.

The cartâ€™s contents are saved on the device using AsyncStorage, simulating a basic online shopping experience.

Features
HomeScreen: Presents a collection of products with an option to add each to the shopping cart.
CartScreen: Displays items added to the cart and provides functionality to remove them.
Add to Cart: Button available on the HomeScreen for adding products to the cart.
Remove from Cart: Button available on the CartScreen for removing products from the cart.
Local Data Storage: Utilizes AsyncStorage to save and retrieve selected items, ensuring persistence.
Design Choices
User Interface
The UI is crafted to be user-friendly and straightforward, guided by the provided mockup:

HomeScreen: Organized into a list format where each item is shown with its name, image, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
CartScreen: Lists the items added to the cart with an option to remove each one, alongside a summary of the total estimated cost.
Headers and Titles: Centrally aligned headers and titles for each screen, clearly indicating their purpose.
Data Storage
